## Coloured-Discord-Themes

# Some themes focused in one color each.

* **Compact-Version:** Will get updates and fixes without having to redownload. Unless it's a file update (Don't happen often)

* **Source Version:** Source needs to be downloaded again to update the file so Compact version is recommended unless you want to edit source on your own!
* **I don't support source version usage. Use on your own.**

* **Regarding animations:** Some animations can only be disabled on Source by taking @ that's before "keyframes" but if you think the animation should be able to be turned off in the compact version pls suggest it.

* **Support and Contact:** Any help needed pls contact me through discord **@Waterin#6451** or **@𝓦𝓪𝓽𝓮𝓻𝓲𝓷#6451** or join my [Support Server](https://discord.gg/ADn3Mqd)

* Feel free to suggest. I'll try to implement if it is really good. ^^
